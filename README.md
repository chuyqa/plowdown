# Alpine Plowdown 

Alpine Linux based Docker file for containerized downloading from file-sharing sites.

### Build:
```
    docker build -t chuyqa/plowdown .
```

### Run:
```
    docker run --name=plowmini -itd chuyqa/plowdown
```

### Running with Attached Remote Storage:
Assuming host OS has mount point /mnt/disk1/Media
```
    docker run --name=plowmini -itd -v /mnt/disk1/Media/:/Media chuyqa/plowdown
```



# Usage

1. Attach to container
```
    docker exec -it plowmini bash
```

2. Choose download method:
a. **Standard plowdown**
```
    plowdown --auth=user:pass https://link_to_download
```

b. Multiple Connections using aria2 (And premium account)
```
    Manually Update login credentials in /opt/scripts/rg
    rg <rapidgator link>
```
    


### Other scripts

**Unrar** : There is a minimal wrapper available with the "Unrar" command. 
    This only unrar's the media files, and will attempt to skip the most
    common HTML/referal link files in most downloads. 
    usage - `Unrar ./file_to_open.rar`
